# What is Python *args?
# The special syntax *args in function definitions in Python is used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. It is used to pass a non-keyworded, variable-length argument list. 

# The syntax is to use the symbol * to take in a variable number of arguments; by convention, it is often used with the word args.
# What *args allows you to do is take in more arguments than the number of formal arguments that you previously defined. With *args, any number of extra arguments can be tacked on to your current formal parameters (including zero extra arguments).
# For example, we want to make a multiply function that takes any number of arguments and is able to multiply them all together. It can be done using *args.
# Using the *, the variable that we associate with the * becomes iterable meaning you can do things like iterate over it, run some higher-order functions such as map and filter, etc.

# Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers. The numbers can be negative or non-integer. If the array does not contain any numbers then you should return 0.

# Given an array/list [] of integers , Find the product of the k maximal numbers.

# Notes
# Array/list size is at least 3 .

# Array/list's numbers Will be mixture of positives , negatives and zeros

# Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur.

# Input >> Output Examples
# maxProduct ({4, 3, 5}, 2) ==>  return (20)
# Explanation:
# Since the size (k) equal 2 , then the subsequence of size 2 whose gives product of maxima is 5 * 4 = 20 .
# maxProduct ({8, 10 , 9, 7}, 3) ==>  return (720)
# Explanation:
# Since the size (k) equal 3 , then the subsequence of size 3 whose gives product of maxima is  8 * 9 * 10 = 720 .
# maxProduct ({10, 8, 3, 2, 1, 4, 10}, 5) ==> return (9600)
# Explanation:
# Since the size (k) equal 5 , then the subsequence of size 5 whose gives product of maxima is  10 * 10 * 8 * 4 * 3 = 9600 .
# maxProduct ({-4, -27, -15, -6, -1}, 2) ==> return (4)
# Explanation:
# Since the size (k) equal 2 , then the subsequence of size 2 whose gives product of maxima is  -4 * -1 = 4 .
# maxProduct ({10, 3, -1, -27} , 3)  return (-30)
# Explanation:
# Since the size (k) equal 3 , then the subsequence of size 3 whose gives product of maxima is 10 * 3 * -1 = -30 .
