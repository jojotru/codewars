#Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.

# If the parameter is itself not a perfect square then -1 should be returned. You may assume the parameter is non-negative.


# 121 --> 144
# 625 --> 676
# 114 --> -1 since 114 is not a perfect square

# Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. The string can contain any char.

# Examples input/output:

# XO("ooxx") => true
# XO("xooxx") => false
# XO("ooxXm") => true
# XO("zpzpzpp") => true // when no 'x' and 'o' is present should return true
# XO("zzoo") => false

# Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

# Don't change the order of the elements that are left.

# Examples
# * Input: [1,2,3,4,5], output = [2,3,4,5]
# * Input: [5,3,2,1,4], output = [5,3,2,4]
# * Input: [2,2,1,2,1], output = [2,2,2,1]

# The reason this also works for strings is that in Python, Strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. !!!!!!!!!!!

# Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

# DropCaps means that the first letter of the starting word of the paragraph should be in caps and the remaining lowercase, just like you see in the newspaper.

# But for a change, let"s do that for each and every word of the given String. Your task is to capitalize every word that has length greater than 2, leaving smaller words as they are.

# *should work also on Leading and Trailing Spaces and caps.

# Given a list of integers, determine whether the sum of its elements is odd or even.

# Give your answer as a string matching "odd" or "even".
